	<h2>History</h2>
	<p1>
		Durham House of Pets was founded in 2005 and five by of CEO Sam Lupinacci. Sam grew up with a love of animals that was nurtured by his father, renowned veterinarian Michael Lupinacci. Sam began volunteering in animal shelters across the state of New Hampshire at an early age and quickly fell in love with the care and rehabilitation process of abused animals. Inspired Sam started his own shelter and rehabilitation center in his hometown of Durham, New Hampshire! Durham House of Pets started off as a singular room but has since grown to a full-scale office building. Today Durham House of Pets cares for over 500 different creatures including some exotic animals such as lions, alligators, crocodiles, and peacocks. Sam now commands a staff of our 50 employees who represent some of the most respected, dedicated, and kindest animal caretakers in New England. The Durham House of Pets original mission statement was <i> to ensure the care and well being of all creatures and seek to find each a permeant homes where th		ey can be happy and loved.</i> From 2005 to 2020 our mission remains the same.
